# Geospatial analysis and representation
Project delivered for the exam of Geospatial Analysis and Representation of the Data Science Master's course at University of Trento. 
The github preview of the "Analysis.ipynb" file is exhaustive regarding the analysis done, while to visualize the Plotly maps it is necessary to execute the file on a Jupyter Notebook. 
We suggest to follow the below procedure: 
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name env --display-name "Geospatial analysis"
jupyter notebook
```
then select the "Analysis.ipynb" file and execute. Be sure the active kernel is the "Geospatial analysis" one.
